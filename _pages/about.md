I am a PhD student in philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I am advised by [Tom Dougherty](https://sites.google.com/site/tomdoughertyphilosophy/), [Kathleen A. Creel](https://kathleenacreel.com/), [Alex Worsnip](https://www.alexworsnip.com/), and [Luc Bovens](https://philosophy.unc.edu/people/luc-bovens/). My research is on normative ethics and the ethics of technology. Before coming to UNC, I earned a BS in computer science and philosophy at Northeastern University. 

At UNC, I am a Graduate Fellow in the Parr Center for Ethics, the Research Associate for the AI Project, and a PPE Affiliated graduate student. In the summer of 2024, I participated in Northeastern's Summer Training Program in AI and Data Ethics.

My dissertation is about the role of privacy in interpersonal relationships and social life. Some of my other current projects include a paper on algorithmic fairness and a paper on methods for improving the transparency of neural networks. 

Outside of philosophy, I enjoy running slow half marathons, doing the NYT crossword, country line dancing (which is, I promise, more fun than it sounds), and watching my cat sit on the back porch.

My name is pronounced Muh-rae-kuh Duh-lay-win.
