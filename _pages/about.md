I am a Ph.D. candidate in philosophy at [The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://philosophy.unc.edu/). Before starting at UNC, I completed an M.A. in philosophy at [Northern Illinois University](https://www.niu.edu/clas/phil/index.shtml) and a B.S. in mathematics and theology at [Lee University](https://www.leeuniversity.edu/) in Cleveland, Tennessee. 

My philosophical interests are broad, but my current work focuses on topics in ethics and epistemology. My dissertation is about the relationship between morality and rationality. 

You can email me at msheeks@unc.edu. You can also find me on [PhilPeople](https://philpeople.org/profiles/meredith-sheeks).
