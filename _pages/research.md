My research spans ethics, epistemology, and philosophy of religion.

The unifying theme of my work is that the ideals that guide our lives are importantly interrelated. I take an ideal that guides our lives to include is any person to whom, or thing to which, we look for guidance on how to live.
Classic examples are morality, rationality, love, truth, etiquette, and God. My work explores the relationships between and among the ideals that guide our lives.

Here is a list of my current publications, along with links to them.

* ###### The Myth of the Good Epistemic Bubble (in [_Episteme_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/abs/myth-of-the-good-epistemic-bubble/B0765DC90737B1A311C8E85D067E7D5D))
    About the relationship between truth and rationality and, well, what to do if you find yourself in an epistemic bubble. 
   
* ###### A Love that Hides (in [_Faith and Philosophy_](https://place.asburyseminary.edu/faithandphilosophy/vol40/iss2/))
    On the relationship between love and God, and why God just might exist, even if God hides from us.


I have several ongoing projects as well. Here are a few of them.

* ###### Morality Unmoralized (My Dissertation) 
    On the relationship between morality and rationality, and why morality isn't the bad guy, despite what some might think.

* ###### The Importance of Being Rude
    About the relationship between morality and etiquette, and how there's a moral point to being rude.

* ###### The Inescapability of the Generality Problem
    About the relationship between rationality and knowledge, and why reliabilism is, let's face it, doomed.

* ###### The Power of Praise
    On the relationship between liberation and solidarity, and how to escape oppressive double binds.
