My research spans ethics, epistemology, and philosophy of religion. The unifying theme of my work is that the ideals that guide our lives do not exist in isolation from one another. An ideal that guides our lives is any person to whom, or thing to which, we look for guidance on how to live. Classic examples include morality, rationality, love, etiquette, and God. When we look to our ideals in isolation from one another, we risk missing the forest for the trees in our attempt to answer the question of how to live. My research aims to mitigate such risk by carefully considering the relationships between and among the ideals that guide our lives.

This paper is about privacy and Taylor Swift :) specifically, about strange and unsettling phenomenon of speculating about her (and others') private life.
