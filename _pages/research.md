My research spans ethics, epistemology, and philosophy of religion. The unifying theme of my work is that the ideals that guide our lives do not exist in isolation from one another. An ideal that guides our lives is any person to whom, or thing to which, we look for guidance on how to live. Classic examples include morality, rationality, love, etiquette, and God. When we look to our ideals in isolation from one another, we risk missing the forest for the trees in our attempt to answer the question of how to live. My research aims to mitigate such risk by carefully considering the relationships between and among the ideals that guide our lives. 

Here is a list of my publications, along with links to them.

#### Dissertation

This paper argues that, contrary to popular trends in the AI fairness debate, we should be pluralists about algorithmic fairness metrics.

#### Other current projects	

This paper argues that adaptive preferences (as theorized by feminist philosophers) can be used to demonstrate why the preferences of domestic animals are sometimes less instructive than they appear.
