My research spans ethics, epistemology, and philosophy of religion. 

The unifying theme of my work is that the ideals that guide our lives are importantly interrelated.
I take the ideals that guide our lives to include any person to whom, or thing to which, we look for guidance on how to live. Classic examples are morality, rationality, love, etiquette, and God.
The better we understand how our guiding ideals are related, the better we may understand how to live.  

Here is a list of my publications, along with links to them.

#### Dissertation

This paper argues that, contrary to popular trends in the AI fairness debate, we should be pluralists about algorithmic fairness metrics.

#### Other current projects	

This paper argues that adaptive preferences (as theorized by feminist philosophers) can be used to demonstrate why the preferences of domestic animals are sometimes less instructive than they appear.
